# FaceRecognition Python
This is the Research Project that we made in Python which trains the facial data of the user and recognizes the user with the trained data and says whether the user is looking towards left or right. This projetc is made by some of the python libraries i.e., OpenCV, NumPy, etc. The XML file is created in order to store trained data. 

### Steps of installation:- 
- Install Pycharm or any pyhton code editor.
- Type ```$ pip install opencv-python``` to install all the required libraries.
- Clone the repository
- int terminal navigate to the project folder and type ```$ python camera-test.py``` to test the camera (While testing you can press q to quit). 
- Then again open the terminal and type ```$ python faces_train.py``` which will train the data into ```trainner.yml``` file.
- Then type ```$ python faces.py``` to run the code.

### Resources:- 
- We have made a [```Research Document```](https://dhruvinbhayani000.medium.com/anticipation-algorithm-172ecac7a7e7) on this project that describes each and everything about this project.
- You can also watch the video of [```working model```](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB276QGf74Q&ab_channel=DhruvinBhayani) of Anticipation Algorithm.
